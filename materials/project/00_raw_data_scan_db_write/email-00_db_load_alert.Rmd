## ⚠️ There was an issue with the food inspection project raw data load. 

Fewer rows were written to the database than expected.  The number of records are: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

df <- tibble::tibble("Raw Data Written" = c("Food Inspections", "Business Licenses"), "Number of Rows" = c(insp_db_rowcount,bus_db_rowcount))

df |> 
  gt::gt() |> 
  gt::fmt_number(columns = "Number of Rows",
             use_seps = TRUE,
             decimals = 0)
```
