## Background

This project illustrates using Posit Team to develop and deploy a data science project featuring:

![](ds-workflows-r.png)

### Scheduled jobs

- Fetching and cleaning data from a continuously updating web source
- Pushing cleaned data to a relational database
- Creating intermediate datasets for subsequent use

### Pins

- Serving intermediate datasets and model objects for use in apps, APIs, and other jobs

### APIs / Vetiver

- Serving model predictions via HTTP requests deployed using vetiver

### Development and Production Apps
  
- Exposing model predictions to end-users through Shiny apps
- Using git-backed deployment to keep a stable version of the application available from the main branch while doing development work on another branch

### Private Packages

- Encapsulate re-usable logic in an R package, and distribute with Package Manager

#### ETL

```{r}
project_r %>% 
  filter(str_detect(title, "00|01")) %>%
  arrange(title) %>%
  rsc_card()
```

#### Modeling

  filter(str_detect(tolower(title), "pinned")) %>%
  rsc_table()
```

### APIs

```{r}
project_r %>%
  filter(str_detect(title, "API")) %>%
  rsc_card()
```

### Apps
