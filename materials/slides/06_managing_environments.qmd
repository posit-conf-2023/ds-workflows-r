## Managing Environments {.toc-light}

![](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/logo.svg){.absolute top="200" left="50" width="260"} ![](slide_resources/devtestprod.png){.absolute top="300" left="310" width="260"}

## Session Outline

-   Environments management (renv, and use PPM as a repository)
-   Dev, test, prod workflows with git backed and CICD
-   hot swap urls
-   deploying content that uses a private package
-   interoperability (maybe just note in the recap)

## Where we are

## How do we keep this all running smoothly?

## How to avoid common pitfalls and look like a professional while doing itâ„¢

-   Manage your environment
-   Use a dev-test-prod workflow

## Environments

> Think of your data science workbench as a kitchen:
>
> -   The [**repository**]{.fuchsia} is the grocery store, a central place where everyone gets their packages.
> -   The [**library**]{.fuchsia} is the pantry, where you keep your own private set of packages.
> -   [**Installation**]{.fuchsia} is the shopping trip to stock your library with packages from the repository.

## (notes)

Talk about PPM as the repository. Have private packages too. this makes it really easy to move from dev to prod.

## Dev-Test-Prod

Ensure your data products behave as expected and there are no surprises.
