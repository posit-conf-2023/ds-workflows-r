## Session Outline

  
- Environments management (renv, and use PPM as a repository)
- Dev, test, prod workflows with git backed and CICD
- hot swap urls
- deploying content that uses a private package
- interoperability (maybe just note in the recap)

## How to avoid common pitfalls and look like a professional while doing itâ„¢

- Manage your environment
- Use a dev-test-prod workflow

## Environments 

> Think of your data science workbench as a kitchen:
>
> - The [**repository**]{.fuchsia} is the grocery store, a central place where everyone gets their packages.
> - The [**library**]{.fuchsia} is the pantry, where you keep your own private set of packages.
> - [**Installation**]{.fuchsia} is the shopping trip to stock your library with packages from the repository.
