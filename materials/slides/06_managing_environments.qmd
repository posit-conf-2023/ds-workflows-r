## Managing Environments {.toc-light}

![](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/logo.svg){.absolute top="200" left="50" width="260"} ![](slide_resources/devtestprod.png){.absolute top="300" left="310" width="260"}

## Session Outline

-   Environments management (renv, and use PPM as a repository)
-   Dev, test, prod workflows with git backed and CICD
-   hot swap urls
-   deploying content that uses a private package
-   interoperability (maybe just note in the recap)

## Where we are

## How do we keep this all running smoothly?

## How to avoid common pitfalls and look like a professional while doing itâ„¢

-   Manage your environment
-   Use a dev-test-prod workflow

## Environments

> Think of your data science workbench as a kitchen:
>
> -   The [**repository**]{.fuchsia} is the grocery store, a central place where everyone gets their packages.
> -   The [**library**]{.fuchsia} is the pantry, where you keep your own private set of packages.
> -   [**Installation**]{.fuchsia} is the shopping trip to stock your library with packages from the repository.


## (notes)

Talk about PPM as the repository. Have private packages too. this makes it really easy to move from dev to prod.

## Dev-Test-Prod

Ensure your data products behave as expected and there are no surprises.

## Environments

ðŸ‘¿ Sometimes things go wrong

::: incremental
-   Revisited an old R script, and it didn't work.
    -   "I swear that {`insert function from package`} worked before..."
-   Shared R code with a colleague, but they can't get it to run.
    -   "Why does this run on my computer, but not on Sue's?"
    -   "John pulled in my project from GitHub but can't get it to work!"
-   You modified something in one project, and borked something in another project.
    -   "I upgraded a package in one project, and now my other projects don't work!"

## Enter `renv`

![](https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/blob/main/PNG/renv.png?raw=true){.absolute top="0" right="1200" width="70"}

The **renv** package helps you create **r**eproducible **env**ironments for your R projects. Use **renv** to make your R projects more:

::: incremental
-   [**Isolated**]{.fuchsia}: Installing a new or updated package for one project **won't break your other projects**, and vice versa. That's because **renv** gives each project its own private package library.

-   [**Portable**]{.fuchsia}: Easily transport your projects from **one computer to another**, even across different platforms. **renv** makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.

-   [**Reproducible**]{.fuchsia}: **renv** **records the exact package versions** you depend on, and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

## `renv.lock`

-   `renv` is designed to keep track of your **PROJECT'S PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES**
-   As your install, update, or delete packages from your project, you want to update your `renv.lock` file using `renv::snapshot()`
