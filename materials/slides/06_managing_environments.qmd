## Managing Environments {.toc-light}

## How do we keep this all running smoothly?

## Improving & Protecting your Workflow

-   Manage your environment
-   Use a dev-test-prod workflow

## Environments

> Think of your data science workbench as a kitchen:
>
> -   A [**repository**]{.fuchsia} is the grocery store, a central place where everyone gets their packages.
> -   A [**library**]{.fuchsia} is the pantry, where you keep your own private set of packages.
> -   A [**Package**]{.fuchsia} is the food!

## Environments

ðŸ‘¿ Sometimes things go wrong

::: incremental
-   Revisited an old R script, and it didn't work.
    -   "I swear that {`insert function from package`} worked before..."
-   Shared R code with a colleague, but they can't get it to run.
    -   "Why does this run on my computer, but not on Sue's?"
    -   "John pulled in my project from GitHub but can't get it to work!"
-   You modified something in one project, and borked something in another project.
    -   "I upgraded a package in one project, and now my other projects don't work!"
:::

## Enter `renv`

![](https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/blob/main/PNG/renv.png?raw=true){.absolute top="0" right="1200" width="70"}

The **renv** package helps you create **r**eproducible **env**ironments for your R projects. Use **renv** to make your R projects more:

::: incremental
-   [**Isolated**]{.fuchsia}: Installing a new or updated package for one project **won't break your other projects**, and vice versa. That's because **renv** gives each project its own private package library.

-   [**Portable**]{.fuchsia}: Easily transport your projects from **one computer to another**, even across different platforms. **renv** makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.

-   [**Reproducible**]{.fuchsia}: **renv** **records the exact package versions** you depend on, and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

## `renv.lock`

-   `renv` is designed to keep track of your **PROJECT'S PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES**
-   As your install, update, or delete packages from your project, you want to update your `renv.lock` file using `renv::snapshot()`

## `renv.lock`

-   `renv` is designed to keep track of your **PROJECT'S PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES**
-   As your install, update, or delete packages from your project, you want to update your `renv.lock` file using `renv::snapshot()`
-   Restore a project's package dependencies using `renv::restore()`

## Dev-Test-Prod

Ensure your data products behave as expected and there are no surprises

![](slide_resources/devtestprod2.png){fig-align="center" height="620"}

## Deployment Methods to Posit Connect

1.  Push-button ![](slide_resources/publishIcon_2x.png){height="50" style="vertical-align:middle"}
2.  Git-backed {{< fa brands git-alt >}}
3.  Programmatic {{< fa gears >}}

ðŸ“£ Push-button is good for rapid prototyping. Beyond that, you really should be using [**git-backed or programmatic deployment via CI/CD pipeline**]{.fuchsia} to keep your code in sync with your deployment.

## Git Backed Deployment

Connect will deploy directly from your git repository

![](https://solutions.posit.co/operations/deploy-methods/git-backed.png){fig-align="center"}

Ref:

-   <https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/git-backed/>

## Dev-Test-Prod Methods [// Git-backed Deployment]{.teal}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](slide_resources/gitbacked.png){height="800"}
:::

::: {.column .smaller width="60%"}
-   Deploy production and test branches

-   Automatically update production with a git merge

-   Stakeholders keep the same stable URL throughout

## Dev-Test-Prod Methods [// CI/CD Deployment]{.fuchsia}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](slide_resources/cicd){height="800"}
:::

::: {.column .smaller width="60%"}
-   A CI/CD pipeline can utilize:
    -   the API directly
    -   a Posit-created GitHub Action
    -   a Python (`rsconnect-python`) or R (`connectapi`) package
-   See <https://solutions.posit.co/operations/deploy-methods/ci-cd/> for examples:
    -   GitHub Actions
    -   GitLab CI/CD
    -   Azure Pipelines
    -   Bitbucket Pipelines
    -   Jenkins
