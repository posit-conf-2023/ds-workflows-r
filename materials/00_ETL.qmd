data_raw <- readr::read_csv("https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/4ijn-s7e5/rows.csv")

Inspect the data

#| label: Data scan

scan <- pointblank::scan_data(data_raw, sections = "OVMS")
scan
# Note the sections argument. We omit "Correlations" and "Interactions" because these aren't relevant for this dataset and take a long time to run on this large of a dataset.
```

Explore the data scan.

1. What is the most common value for `dba_name` and `AKA Name` (hint: Toggle details)
1. Explore the `facility_type`. What values should we consider filtering out or preserving?
1. Are there columns that we should cross reference for validation?
