## ⚠️ There was an issue with the food inspection project data for validation. 

The data frame validation checks for expected column schema, columns present, and at least 100k rows of data. 

Due to the data frame integrity issues, further processing of the data did not take place. **Downstream content and artifacts are not updated.**

The results of the data frame validation are shown below: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

agent_df_integrity
```

```{r}
 # get_agent_report(agent_df_integrity,display_table = FALSE) |> filter(n_pass < units)
# glue("the number of failures in address were {xlist$n_failed[[3]]}")
```
