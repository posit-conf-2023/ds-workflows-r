## API call within a Shiny App

In this exercise, we will interact with a Shiny application that makes interactive calls to the [Food Inspections API](https://connect.conf23workflows.training.posit.co/food-inspections-api/).

Navigate to the `ds-workflows-r/materials/activities/activity-07_shiny/` directory, and open the file called `app.R`.

This application does two things:

1.  Take in user inputs for a food establishment and,
2.  Make a prediction by calling the food inspections API

## Task 1 - Run the App!

With the `app.R` file open, you should see a `Run App` button at the top of your screen. Click it and try interacting with the app!

This is a pretty basic app, and if you are familiar with Shiny, feel free to make some cosmetic enhancements!

## Task 2 - Publish the Shiny app to Posit Connect

### Publish to Posit Connect

Similar to how you published a Quarto document, go ahead and publish the Shiny application you just created to Posit Connect. Here are the steps to guide you:

1.  Have the `app.R` file open
2.  Click the publishing button ![](../slides/slide_resources/publishIcon_2x.png){height="20" style="vertical-align:middle"}
3.  Follow the pop-up window instructions to publish to Posit Connect!
