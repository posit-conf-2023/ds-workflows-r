# Use *R Markdown* to apply formatting to your email. This is big header!

Tips:

- preview your email as you go with ` blastula::render_connect_email("activity-04_email.Rmd")`
- use inline code to mix text and computations, e.g., **there are `r nrow(inspections_validated)` validated inspection records**
- or add code chunks 
- set your code chunk options to `echo=FALSE` to suppress code in your output


```{r echo=FALSE}



```
